# Workflow CA

Improve the quality of a package by establishing helpful workflows that make the development process more efficient.

## Configuration

- **Prettier**: Code formatter
- **ESLint**: A ESLint is a tool designed to analyse the code you have written and warn or automatically fix issues it detects. This tool goes much further than a language formatter (such as Prettier) and can prevent you from making mistakes in your code.
- **Husky**: It is a powerful tool to streamline project development processes and increase quality control.
- **Jest**: Unit testing to confirm that a function is working correctly.
- **Cypress**: end-to-end testing framework that runs in the browser.
